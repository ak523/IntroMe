## About me
Hello All,

I'm Hetvi.

My friends call me Heer. I'm pursing my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Engineering from Charotar University of Science and Technology and currently studying in Third year. 

I love programming, mathematics and mythology. I play Guitar in my free time.

Also, I love sweets and chocolates. üç´üßÅSo on that note let me share with you guys one sweet poem on chocolates:

" ***Chocolate is sweet and so good to eat.***</br>

 &nbsp; ***I like it whenever, I need a good treat.***</br>

&nbsp; ***In brownies and cookies and chocolate cake,***</br>

&nbsp; ***It adds extra sweetness to everything you bake.***</br>

&nbsp; ***White chocolate, dark chocolate and milk chocolate galore ***</br> 

&nbsp; ***I know I could eat 100 pieces or more! That is for sure ;)"***

Thank You
